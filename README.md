# EcoThreads

EcoThreads tackles one main problem ãƒ¼ to consume fashion sustainability at the comfort of your home. 

Through EcoThreads, users will have inventory of their entire closet right at the click of a button. 
In the closet, users can input all the items in their own closet and the app will organize it into categories, like tops, bottoms, outerwear, and more. The app can also generate different outfits for them using what they have in their closets. A main feature of EcoThreads is the statistics pages. The algorithm will show the users weekly stats, such as your average amount of carbon saved, to the percentage of weekly generated outfits.
